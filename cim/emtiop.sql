-- Compound types are represented as separate 1:1 tables and enforces via
-- a combination of the use of both UNIQUE on columns that reference tables
-- representing Compound types and corresponding FK column constraint
-- definitions to those tables.
-- 
-- Though Compounds do not have an "mRID" and do not inherantly represent
-- persistent objects in the CIM (i.e. are inherited from IdentifiedObject)
-- they are here given a unique identifier "id" that is distinct from "mRID"
-- and used for persistence purposes.
-- 
-- Tables that represent Compound types in the CIM are not normalized for
-- the following reasons:
-- 
--   Normalization, particularly to 3NF, typically requires:
--     No repeating groups.
--     No partial or transitive dependencies.
--     Every non-key attribute must depend only on the whole key.
--     
--   But compound classes in the CIM domain:
--     Do not have surrogate or natural primary keys derived from business rules.
--     Are logically value objects: any change to any attribute means the value is distinct.
--     Have implicit semantic atomicity — they’re treated as indivisible chunks.

-- A line segment is a conductor or combination of conductors, with consistent
-- electrical characteristics along its length, building a single electrical
-- system that carries alternating current between two points in the power
-- system.
-- The BaseVoltage at the two ends of a line segment shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage.
-- However, boundary lines may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages
-- and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires
-- use of an equivalent branch.
-- Line segment impedances can be either directly described in electrical
-- terms or physical line detail can be provided from which impedances can
-- be calculated.
-- <b>Directly described impedances</b>
-- For symmetrical, transposed three phase line segments, it is sufficient
-- to use attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances
-- for the entire length of the line segment. Additionally, line segment impedances
-- can be computed by using line segment length and associated per length
-- impedances.
-- Unbalanced modeling of impedances is supported by the per length phase
-- impedance matrix (PerLengthPhaseImpedance) in conjunction with phase-to-sequence
-- number mapping supplied by either ACLineSegmentPhase or WirePosition. The
-- sequence numbers are referenced by the row and column attributes of the
-- per length phase impedance matrix. This method enables single-phase and
-- two-phase line segments, and transpositions of phases, to be described
-- using the same per length phase impedance matrix. The length of the line
-- segment is used in the computation of total impedance values for the line
-- segment.
-- <b>Line detail characteristics</b>
-- There are three approaches to providing line detail and all use WireAssembly
-- to supply line positions:
-- <ul>
-- <li>Option 1 - WireAssembly supplies only line positions. ACLineSegmentPhase
-- points to wire type and intraphase spacing and supplies the phase-to-sequence
-- number mapping.</li>
-- <li>Option 2 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position,
-- also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing. ACLineSegmentPhase supplies
-- the phase-to-sequence number mapping.</li>
-- <li>Option 3 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position,
-- also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing and phase. WireAssembly
-- therefore supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping and ACLineSegmentPhase
-- is not needed.</li>
-- </ul>

-- The unit multipliers defined for the CIM. When applied to unit symbols,

-- a single-character unit symbol. Unit symbols should not contain multipliers,
-- and it should be left to the multiplier to define the multiple for an entire
-- data type.
-- For example, if a unit symbol is "m2Pers" and the multiplier is "k", then
-- the value is k(m**2/s), and the multiplier applies to the entire final
-- value, not to any individual part of the value. This can be conceptualized
-- by substituting a derived unit symbol for the unit type. If one imagines
-- that the symbol "&#222;" represents the derived unit "m2Pers", then applying
-- the multiplier "k" can be conceptualized simply as "k&#222;".
-- For example, the SI unit for mass is "kg" and not "g". If the unit symbol
-- is defined as "kg", then the multiplier is applied to "kg" as a whole and
-- does not replace the "k" in front of the "g". In this case, the multiplier
-- of "m" would be used with the unit symbol of "kg" to represent one gram.
-- As a text string, this violates the instructions in IEC 80000-1. However,
-- because the unit symbol in CIM is treated as a derived unit instead of
-- as an SI unit, it makes more sense to conceptualize the "kg" as if it were
-- replaced by one of the proposed replacements for the SI mass symbol. If
-- one imagines that the "kg" were replaced by a symbol "&#222;", then it
-- is easier to conceptualize the multiplier "m" as creating the proper unit
-- "m&#222;", and not the forbidden unit "mkg".

-- The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived

-- symbol Farad is defined as "F" instead of "CPerV". In cases where a standard
-- symbol does not exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit is used
-- as the unit symbol. For example, density does not have a standard symbol
-- and so it is represented as "kgPerm^3". With the exception of the "kg",
-- which is an SI unit, the unit symbols do not contain multipliers and therefore

-- Every unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if it were a single-letter
-- symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying
-- descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.
-- To allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring
-- special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate
-- from the format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol "/" is replaced
-- by the letters "Per". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit
-- as "m^3". The letters "deg" are used instead of the degree symbol. Any
-- clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included in the description
-- for the unit symbol.
-- Non-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data
-- to be correctly labelled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor
-- that is reporting numbers that represent feet instead of meters). This
-- allows software to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and
-- scale the raw data of those sources into SI-based units.
